It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set\\'s elements. For example, if a group consists of 20 individuals, a majority would be 11 or more individuals, while having 10 or fewer individuals would not constitute a majority. \"Majority\" can be used to specify the voting requirement, as in a \"majority vote\", which means more than half of the votes cast.\\nA majority can be compared to a plurality (sometimes called relative majority), which is a subset larger than any other subset but not necessarily larger than all other subsets combined. For example, if there is a group with 20 members which is divided into subgroups with 9, 6, and 5 members, then the 9-member group would be the plurality. A plurality is not necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set\\'s elements. This can occur when there are three or more possible choices. The (absolute) majority is sometimes referred to as a \"simple\" majority, compared to a supermajority (a majority requirement above 50%, like a 2/3 requirement), however use of this term is inconsistent as it sometimes refers to a mere plurality (as opposed to an absolute majority).\\nIn British English the term \"majority\" is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e., the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher. Other related terms containing the word \"majority\" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.'"

The divisive nature of disputed subjects has triggered arguments, since opinions on a given issue differ.  These subjects are responsible for a great deal of tension among Wikipedia editors, reflecting the debates of society as a whole.  Perspectives on these subjects are affected by the time, place, and culture of the editor.\\n\\nArticles listed here may need more work than usual to approach a neutral point of view. For articles that are currently unbalanced, see NPOV dispute instead.\\nArticles on this list should be checked from time to time to monitor developments in the presentation of the issues. Use the \"related changes\" link to quickly review changes to these articles.\\nDiscussions about those controversies should be limited to the relevant Talk pages. For more information, see Wikipedia:Controversial articles.\\n\\n'"
